I've wanted to start collecting and publishing my thoughts about the video games that I'm playing.
Not so much in the review sense, as I don't plan on affixing ratings to games or trying to get my
writing onto public review websites or anything, but more in the vein of a collection of notes taken
while studying.

I tried to do this a couple years ago while playing Baldur's Gate, but I was taking notes via pen
and paper in a notebook that I use for other notes during the day, and for whatever reason I couldn't
stick with that as the collection medium. Since I've been wanting to try out Jekyll, game studies 
seemed like a good topic around which to get to know Jekyll and also get in a cadence of regularly
publishing posts to a hosted website. I plan on hosting this blog as a sub-site in my personal
portfolio, which is currently hosted via Github Pages.

I'm currently playing [Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch (remastered)][ni-no-kuni] on PS4, as
well as [Hades][hades] on Switch. For now, my goal is to play a little bit of one or the other, 
hopefully daily, and write up some quick thoughts about design elements that jump out at me. Daily 
might be a bit of a lofty goal, but we'll see how it goes. I could see the daily posts being more
of a "notes" format with longer, more fleshed out writing happening after picking up on themes from
the notes.
